<p align="justify">Welcome to my developer page on GitHub! My name is Raul Bras and I currently live in this surreal country we call Brazil. I have a degree in Information Technology (Computer Science) and I work in the Business Intelligence segment as a Full Stack Developer. In my free time, I like to study Data Science and practice Machine Learning using Python. You can contact me on any of the social networks below.</p>

 <p align="justify">By the way, you will not see my full name, birth date, home address, family photos, or any other personal data on these social networks. This is not public information that can be collected and sold by those big tech companies. Nor would I ever install any social network app on my phone. If you post your personal data on any social media, then consider watching this series produced by the newspaper "The New York Times": <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/23/opinion/data-privacy-jaron-lanier.html">JARON LANIER FIXES THE INTERNET</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">The world has become quite chaotic and complex in the last few decades, hyperconnected and fast-changing, yet with a total “bad vibe". After millennia of civilization we still have wars, massacres, genocides, heinous crimes, human rights violations, etc. In my opinion, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history:&nbsp; WE ARE ALL HUMANS, A SINGLE PEOPLE OF A SINGLE SPECIES.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout this terrible pandemic, the immense number of deaths reminded us that human life is like a burning candle, just a blow to extinguish it. In view of this, I decided to put into practice an old dream of creating an NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) in the area of human rights. The name of the initiative is United Sapiens - the idea is to act globally. My main goal would be to support the United Nations' efforts to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts and political rivalries.</p>

```
     ------ WE THE SAPIENS ------

     WE ARE SAPIENS
     ONE PEOPLE OF ONE SPECIES
     TOGETHER WE'LL BE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'LL BE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY RACE, CASTE OR RELIGION
     OUR UNION WILL BECOME LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I created a <a href="https://github.com/united-sapiens">GitHub Organization</a> to host the initiative's project. I'll try to contribute with what I know, programming and making free / open source software available. You can also contribute, but only if you want to. Anyway, your comments and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
