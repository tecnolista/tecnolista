<p align="justify">The world has become quite chaotic and complex in recent decades, hyperconnected and rapidly changing, but with a dark “negative vibe” arising from the rise of the far right in several countries. After millennia of civilization we still have wars, massacres, genocides, heinous crimes, human rights violations, etc. In my opinion, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history: we are all human, a single people of a single species. We are Sapiens, the last surviving species of the Homo lineage. We have a huge responsibility to keep evolution going to ensure the emergence and survival of the next species. We have a duty to leave a better world for our descendants.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout this terrible pandemic, the staggering number of deaths reminded us that human life is like a lit candle, with just one breath to go out. In view of this, I decided to put into practice an old dream in the area of human rights. The name of the initiative is "Sapiens United"; the idea is to act in international relations between countries to protect democracies at risk. As more countries become members, this initiative could evolve into an intergovernmental organization, aiming to promote cooperation and exchange of experiences between countries with truly social-democratic policies. Countries that have a legally established commitment to democracy and that intend to remain free from authoritarianism or any other "ism" that threatens their democracy.</p>

```
     ------ WE THE SAPIENS ------

     WE ALL ARE SAPIENS
     ONE PEOPLE OF ONE SPECIES
     TOGETHER WE'LL BE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'LL BE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY RACE, CASTE OR RELIGION
     OUR UNION WILL BECOME LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I started an <a href="https://github.com/United-Sapiens">Organization on GitHub</a> to host the initiative's work. I also created the mantra "We, The Sapiens", a short text in the form of a poem, to try to "plant the idea" that a better world is possible. I will try to contribute with what I know how to do, programming and writing the project documentation. All implemented software will be made available as free and open source software (public domain). You can also contribute, but only if you want to. Anyway, your comments and suggestions are always welcome.</p>
